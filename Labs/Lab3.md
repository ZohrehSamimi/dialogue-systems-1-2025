We used English proverbs in our final project. I tested several proverbs from my game project using an automatic speech recognizer. Many were recognized well when spoken slowly and clearly, but I noticed several recurring issues:

Some proverbs with rare words or odd phrasing were mistranscribed. For example, "Jack of all trades and master of none" was transcribed as "Jack os all trades and master of nun" due to the unusual structure and uncommon wording.

Proverbs with uncommon words like "stepping stone" or "frying pan" were sometimes misrecognized depending on my pronunciation.

I have a mild accent (e.g., [your accent here if relevant]), which might affect how words like “unity,” “variety,” or “garbage” are interpreted.

In general, the recognizer favored more common phrases and struggled with idioms or sayings that aren’t frequent in day-to-day conversation. This could impact gameplay for users who don’t speak in a "standard" accent or who recite sayings too quickly.
